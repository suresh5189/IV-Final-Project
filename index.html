      <h1>DASHBOARD OVERVIEW</h1>
      <div class="para1">
        <p>
          I created an Amazon sales dashboard using Tableau that is designed to
          help us understand how our sales are trending over time and which
          products are driving the most revenue. The data for the dashboard
          comes directly from our Amazon sales database and is updated daily.
          The dashboard includes several visualizations that are designed to
          help us understand different aspects of our sales performance. The
          primary visualization is a line chart that shows sales by week over
          the past three months. This chart allows us to see how our sales are
          changing over time and identify any trends or patterns. We're also
          using a stacked bar chart to show sales by product category. This
          chart allows us to see which product categories are driving the most
          revenue and how that revenue is distributed across different
          categories. The key metrics displayed in the dashboard are total
          sales, sales by week, and sales by product category. These metrics are
          important because they help us understand how our sales are changing
          over time and which products are driving the most revenue. Users can
          interact with the dashboard by filtering the data by date range or
          product category. They can also hover over data points to see more
          details. The dashboard is designed for executives who need a
          high-level view of sales performance, as well as for sales managers
          who need to drill down into specific product categories. By using the
          dashboard, we can gain several key insights into our sales
          performance. For example, we can see that sales have been trending
          upward over the past month and that our top-performing product
          categories are electronics and home goods. This information can be
          used to make decisions about inventory and marketing campaigns.
          Overall, the dashboard provides a valuable tool for monitoring our
          Amazon sales and making data-driven decisions.

          An Amazon sales dataset refers to a collection of data related to the
          sales of products on Amazon's online marketplace. This dataset
          typically contains a wealth of information related to the products,
          sales, and customers on the platform, which can be used for various
          analyses and insights.

        <p style="margin: 20px; line-height: 27px">
          The "Quantity by week and Category" sheet in the dashboard provides a
          detailed breakdown of the quantity of products sold by week and
          product category. This sheet is useful for identifying which product
          categories are performing well or poorly, as well as how sales trends
          are changing over time. The sheet is designed to be interactive,
          allowing users to filter the data by week or product category. This
          enables users to quickly drill down into specific time periods or
          product categories to gain deeper insights into sales performance. The
          sheet includes several visualizations, including a stacked bar chart
          and a line chart. The stacked bar chart shows the breakdown of sales
          by product category for each week, allowing users to quickly identify
          which categories are driving the most sales. The line chart shows the
          trend in quantity sold over time, allowing users to see how sales are
          changing week over week.

          The "Quantity by Status and Category" sheet in the dashboard provides
          a breakdown of the quantity of products sold by order status and

          categories are driving the most sales for different order statuses,
          such as shipped, pending, or cancelled. The sheet is designed to be
          interactive, allowing users to filter the data by product category or

          quantity of products sold by top 10 states, product category, and
          shipping service level. This sheet is useful for identifying which
          states are driving the most sales, which categories are most popular
          in those states, and which shipping service levels are preferred by
          customers in those states. The sheet is designed to be interactive,
          allowing users to filter the data by product category, shipping
          service level, or specific states. This enables users to quickly drill
          down into specific categories, shipping service levels or states to
          gain deeper insights into sales performance. The sheet includes
          several visualizations, including a map, stacked bar chart, and tree
          map. The map shows the total quantity of products sold in each state,
          allowing users to quickly identify which states are driving the most
          sales. The stacked bar chart shows the breakdown of sales by product
          category and shipping service level for each state, allowing users to
